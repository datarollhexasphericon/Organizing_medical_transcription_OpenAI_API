# Organizing Medical Transcriptions using OpenAI API

## Overview
Here I apply OpenAI API to automatically extract medical information from the medical transcripts and automate the matching with the appropriate ICD-10 codes. The ICD-10 codes are a standardized system used worldwide for diagnosing and billing purposes, such as insurance claims processing.

## Motivation
Medical professionals frequently document patient encounters in natural language transcripts, detailing symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments. These transcripts can be utilized for various medical documentation purposes, including insurance claims. However, due to the dense nature of the medical information, accurately extracting key data from these transcripts can be challenging.

## Data
